# README: tab-delimited key-value pairs for parameters
# NOTE: script will ignore commented and blank lines

#### you may want to change these (input/output) ####
# top-level demultiplexed directory (off the instrument itself)
DEMUX_DIRECTORY ./

# output read count file
COUNT_FILE	read_counts.tsv

# change to "true" (do not include quotes) if running iSeq data
ISEQ	false

# change to "false" (do not include quotes) if you want to use Bowtie2 aligner
BWA	true

# number of threads to run sample analyses
NTHREADS	1

#### you might want to change these (annotations) ####
# bowtie2 indexed fasta file containing parasite genome (if using your own, please run bowtie2-build first)
REF_GENOME	reference.fasta

# gff file with amplicon ID and coordinates
ANNOTATION_FILE	amplicons.gff

#### you can probably leave these alone (qc parameters) ####
# minimum read length to retain (default 70 bp)
MIN_LENGTH	70

# minimum base quality (PHRED score) to keep (default 2)
MIN_BQ	2

# maximum number of "N" bases allowed in read (default 1)
MAX_N	1

# max insert size for bowtie2 (default 1000 bp)
MAX_INSERT_SIZE 500

# max amount of soft clipping allowed (only applies to bwa mem)
MAX_SOFTCLIP	20

#### use these parameters instead if you want read counts for all genes across the 3d7 genome ####
# ANNOTATION_FILE genes.gff
